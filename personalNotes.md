I have almost no experience/ practically no experience with Gitbash or Github. The class notes are not super descriptive so I have to search for YouTube videos with minimal experience, which is not very time-effective since I'm not entirely sure what to do and what to search for. I am also entirely teaching myself off of Google searches paired with YouTube videos, and just using a ton of time with getting error codes and going down rabbit hole after rabbit hole of how to fix error codes A lot of videos and Google resources don't show how to use GitBash super well, and many people opt to use just GitHub. In addition to this, I was halfway through this assigment and realized I was working in the wrong repo. When I went to restart, my local repo on my desktop wass not synched properly, and I was truely lost. I asked one of my Computer Science friends to help me and he wqs able to help me re set it up, and explained to me very clearly what the commands I learned on youtube were, giving me a much better overall understanding of Git and Github.
